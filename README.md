# Artifacts for Paper #1152: Combating Falsification of Speech Videos with Live Optical Signatures

We provide code and resources below. Note that we cannot release the dataset of videos we collected with our core unit present or the multi-camera dataset we collect for validating our digests, as they contain personally identifiable information (participant faces) and, Further, our IRB explicitly bars these videos' release. All other datasets discussed in the paper are open-source and can be downloaded by examining the provided citations.

Contents as follows:
- system: Setup guide for building your own VeriLight core unit and all code necessary for real-time speech operation and offline verification. Refer to system/README.md for an overview of these resources.
- adversarial_attacks: Code for reproducing our adversarial attacks on VeriLight signatures. Refer to the individual attack READMEs for further details.
